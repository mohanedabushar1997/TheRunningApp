 * # Running App Implementation Documentation
 * 
 * ## Overview
 * 
 * This document provides an overview of the implementation of the running app,
 * a Flutter-based application for tracking running workouts. The app includes
 * features for GPS tracking, voice coaching, music integration, achievements,
 * and more.
 * 
 * ## Architecture
 * 
 * The app follows a layered architecture:
 * 
 * 1. **Presentation Layer**: UI components, screens, and widgets
 * 2. **Business Logic Layer**: Controllers and services
 * 3. **Data Layer**: Models, repositories, and data services
 * 4. **Device Layer**: Device-specific services (GPS, battery, etc.)
 * 
 * ## Key Features Implemented
 * 
 * ### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
 * - **Voice Coach & Feedback**: Text-to-speech announcements during workouts
 * - **Notifications System**: Workout reminders and achievement notifications
 * - **Music Integration**: Control music during workouts
 * - **Onboarding Flow**: User profile creation and app introduction
 * 
 * ### Phase 3: Motivation Features
 * - **Achievement System**: Badges and rewards for workout milestones
 * 
 * ### Phase 4: Technical Improvements
 * - **Battery Optimization**: Adaptive location tracking to save battery
 * - **Background Service**: Continue tracking when app is in background
 * - **Data Persistence**: Store workout data and settings
 * 
 * ### Phase 5: Final Polishing
 * - **App Settings**: Comprehensive settings screen
 * - **Treadmill Workout Support**: Track indoor treadmill workouts
 * 
 * ## File Structure
 * 
 * - **lib/**: Main source code directory
 *   - **app.dart**: App entry point and configuration
 *   - **main.dart**: Application initialization
 *   - **data/**: Data models and services
 *     - **models/**: Data models
 *     - **services/**: Data services
 *   - **device/**: Device-specific services
 *     - **audio/**: Audio and music services
 *     - **background/**: Background service
 *     - **gps/**: Location services
 *     - **services/**: Other device services
 *   - **presentation/**: UI components
 *     - **screens/**: App screens
 *     - **widgets/**: Reusable UI components
 *   - **providers/**: State management
 * 
 * ## Dependencies
 * 
 * The app uses several Flutter packages:
 * - **flutter_tts**: For text-to-speech
 * - **geolocator**: For GPS tracking
 * - **sqflite**: For local database
 * - **shared_preferences**: For settings storage
 * - **flutter_local_notifications**: For notifications
 * - **flutter_background_service**: For background tracking
 * - **path_provider**: For file system access
 * - **provider**: For state management
 * 
 * ## Implementation Notes
 * 
 * - The app uses a singleton pattern for services to ensure only one instance exists
 * - Battery optimization adjusts location tracking parameters based on battery level
 * - The background service uses isolates for continued tracking when the app is closed
 * - Data persistence uses SQLite for workout data and shared preferences for settings
 * 
 * ## Future Improvements
 * 
 * - Add social sharing features
 * - Implement tips and advice feature
 * - Add more workout types beyond running and treadmill
 * - Improve data visualization with charts and graphs
 * - Add support for external sensors (heart rate monitors, etc.)
